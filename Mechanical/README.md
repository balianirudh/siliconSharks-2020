# Mechanical Subsystems

The ROV is made up of several mechanical subsystems. The primary mechanical systems of the ROV are the frame, the main electronics
enclosure, the camera enclosures, and the gripper. Our goal was to make a neutrally buoyant, compact, and easily-assembled ROV. To do this, there was a constant emphasis on original design and exploiting custom fabrication.

## Frame

When designing the frame of the ROV, the focus was put on creating a high strenth, lightweight, customizable structure with room for adaptability and expasion. The frame was produced thorugh addititive manufacturing (3D printing) due to its rapid prototyping capabilities and ease of customizable. PLA plastic was the primary plastic used for manufacturing because it was a plastic that was not only strong enough, but it is safe to use in underwater applications.

The parts that make up the frame are connected in several ways. The main way is through brackets that are soley meant to bring a general structure to the frame. From here, specific parts such as the main electronics housing or thruster guards reinforce the frame while serving different purposes altogether.

In the process of desiging the frame, considerations had to made for the propulsion of the ROV. The team was constrainted to 4 thrusters. With these 4 thrusters, the team had to maximize the ROV's degrees of freedom. The way this was done is discussed in the next section.

## Propulsion

As stated before, the team was constrained to 4 thrusters. This constraint stems from the regulations of the MATE competition and the thrusters chosen for this ROV. For safety reasons, teams participating in the Ranger class are limited to a 25 amp power supply. The thrusters chosen for this ROV were the Blue Robotics T200 thruster. This thruster was chosen because of its force to current ratio and relative affordability.

Knowing that the power supply can only supply 25 amps, in the electrical design, 20 amps was allocated to the propulsion system. This maximizes the current dedicated to thrusters while leaving enough current for other electrical components and a safety buffer. Maximizing the total thrust force is advantageous for obvious reasons. It would provide the maximum agility and make the ROV practical for real-world applications.
