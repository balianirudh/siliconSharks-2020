# Electrical System

The electrical system consists of the electronics that are used to make the ROV operational. The electrical system is designed to provide 
power and communication through all the sensors and cameras with minimal power consumption and with simple circuitry. Our vehicle is
surface powered by a 12-volt external power supply then converted onboard to 5V and 3.3V logic to power the thrusters, cameras, sensors, 
and lighting systems. The vehicle is controlled by a controller from a station above water through a communication system and the video 
captured by its cameras is displayed on a computer monitor.
