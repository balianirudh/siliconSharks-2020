# Silicon Sharks ROV 2020

The Silicon Sharks are a high school robotics team that participate in the MATE underwater robotics competition. As a team, our mission is to develop a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that is capable of exploring public waterways with features for drivers to easily perform tasks and collect data. The five-person team worked together to create this ROV. The Silicon Sharks have three separate subteams (design, electrical, and software) that each played a key role in developing the ROV. My role on the 2020 team was to lead the design and electrical subteams.
